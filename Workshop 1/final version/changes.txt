Changes we have done according to peer review suggestions:

- "+" signs are removed because they are not following domain model common

- Double horizontal line has been removed because conceptual classes in domain model have just name and attributes.
 
-The member has now a direct association with the calendar, where it can be accessed. We thought that it was important for the member to access the calendar and not just the secretary.

-Notations for our associations have been changed and worked on, even the naming for some of them has been changed. We made this change because it wasn't following the right UML format.

-The addition of more attributes have also been made to the model. We got some feedback regarding the lack of attributes and then decided to add some extra to compliment the requirements.

-The member has to pay a membership fee to assign a boat to a berth. This whole process is now also logged in a record, so the history of berth registration is now implemented. The group
decided to add this since it was one part of the requirements we missed the first time. 

- Connection between secretary and berth is implemented, if we look at the requirements for assigning berths it's states that the secretary approves the booking of berths.

Changes we haven't done according to peer review suggestions:

- Association "change" and "remove" between member and boat is not incorporated. We think that is wrong since the teacher has already explained in the lectures that it's enough to have
one association, in this case we used "owns" which basically explains the whole thing.

- Secretary class is kept in our model. We think that secretary class is needed because someone needs to manage the calendar and approve berths.
