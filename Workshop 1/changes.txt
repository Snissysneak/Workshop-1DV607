-The member has now a direct association with the calendar, where it can be accessed.

-Notations for our associations have been changed and worked on, even the naming for some of them has been changed. 

-The addition of more attributes have also been made to the model.

-The member has to pay a membership fee to assign a boat to a berth. This whole process is now also logged in a record, so the history of berth registration is now implemented.

Changes we have done according to peer review suggestions:

- "+" signs are removed
- Double horizontal line has been removed 


Changes we haven't done according to peer review suggestions:

- Association "change" and "remove" between member and boat is not incorporated. We think that is wrong
- Connection between secretary and berth is not incorporated. We believe that is unnecessary.
- Secretary class is kept in our model. We think that secretary class is needed.
